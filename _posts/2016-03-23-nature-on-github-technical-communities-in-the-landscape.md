I recently did a talk for [Laura Pullig](http://www.laurapullig.com/) and her symposium on Nature and Technology about how some of my recent work has been about technical communities in Nature. Particularly I talked about my research leading up to my work with the collective I co-founded with **Hwa Young Young** and **Glenn Boulter**, [Domestic Science](http://domesticscience.org.uk) for our [Ok Sparks](http://slyrabbit.net/ok-sparks) project. I talked about a few things;

 * Amateur Radio Morse Walkers
 * ITaaU Mountain Rescue Project
 * RAYS resilience networks
 * [Lora Alliance](https://www.lora-alliance.org/)

I also talked about **MCQNs** [CockleCraft-Of-Things](https://github.com/mcqn/cocklecraft-of-things) and some of these thoughts made their way into [my approach to the Ok Sparks! project](http://slyrabbit.net/cq-cq-this-is-gb2wcr-calling-cq/)

I think after listening to all the other presenters and their ideas and particularly the many approaches to presenting artworks as DIY kits **Neil Winterburn**, **Laura Pullig** and I have began thinking about **Critical Making**. More on that soon..
