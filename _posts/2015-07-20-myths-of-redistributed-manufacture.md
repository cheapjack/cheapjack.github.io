## Future Makespaces in Redistributed Manufacturing Symposium

<img src="/images/minelucky.png" width = "600">

[@FMs_RdM](https://twitter.com/FMs_RdM)

I'm at an [RCA](http://futuremakespaces.rca.ac.uk/) symposium exploring **"Future Makespaces in Redistributed Manufacturing"**  I've been following and indeed taking part and promoting the harnassing of emerging and established 'maker' communities and related 'enthusiasts' in the cultural sphere. With the growth of information/'tech' culture it's no surprise that we are now looking at how Makerspace/Hackspace culture could affect the means of production at scale. 

For me it follows on from moving into [DoESLiverpool](http://doesliverpool.com), my [PublicEngineering project](http://wiki.doesliverpool.com/PublicEngineering) and research like the great [NESTA makerspace mapping](http://www.nesta.org.uk/UK-makerspaces/dataset) by [Hannah Stewart](https://twitter.com/Freerange_Inc) and [@hwayoung's](https://twitter.com/hwayoung) exploration of **'the maker belt'** alongside the continuing trend for cultural hackathons which I recently tried my hand at for the [The Hub UK](http://thehubuk.com/) with [Bring&Byte](http://bringandbyte.co.uk). 

These are my notes on the speakers and thought exercises. 

5 million RaspPI have been sold and some 10K Arduino's a month are sold (no ref on this)

How will this plateau out and impact on the future of invention: there is a surface tier that is extremely wide and broad and then a lesser known clowdy dark matter tier.

####Are there suspect motives behind Utilising Maker-ness? 

#### Barcelona makerspace example:

Tensions between the 'community' and what funders want

Case by case is important

###Maintaining diversity

<img src="/images/AntiqueSmallEngineClub.jpg" width = "600">

Every year I go to [North West Vintage Rally](http://www.northwestvintagerally.co.uk/) and use it as my ['standard candle'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_candle) for festival style engagement: there's everything from Dog shows to Fairground Organs to 2-stroke engine clubs. I think it's a good model because

 * No overt conceptual framework
 * Guaranteed family friendly crowds
 * Strong and diverse community (although pretty older white male) 
 * Fairly off-trend enthusiasms
 * People who visit have an intuitive sense of the value of exhibitions
 * Randomly mixed with old school fairground caller C.R.E.A.M (Cash Rules Everything Around Me)
 * Channeling Fred Dibner, Maker Faire and The Antiques Road Show
 * [Norman's Organs](http://www.normansorgans.co.uk/)
 * Resilient yet still part funded by Halton Borough Council
 * Dogs towing carts

I'm only referring to this to make sure in our analysis and mapping and utilisation feasibility studying we don't forget the random spirit of creativity and making without clear aims and objectives that is the real fountain of the technical culture. Another form of Dark Matter surely...

### Dark Matter of Maker Spaces

#### Clumping

Are makerspaces really designed? Should they be? Relationships to hackerspace culture

We want to Redistibute Manufacturing but we dont want to **run** redistributed manufacture in the NorthWest

Support the community not absorb or control it.

Access and sector the Dark Matter of Venn Diagrams

#### There is no easy win to dark matter issues;

The main thing about it is we cant see it easily that's why we use the metaphor:
Dangers are cultural gestures and cultural visibility...

Hiding Manufacturing from the Makerspaces to engage What is local?

Sounds like we need established manufacturing services in order for them to run the smaller manufacturing models that allows people to order 10 circuit boards. 

Need high volume to float the low volume and bespoke.

Allow a smaller business model to exist within a bigger one

## Good & Bad

### Ethics of home manufacturing and "Maker Movements in the home" Who will ruthlessly exploit the *material* of 'Maker-ness' 

### Reverse Engineering the Gulf Stream

Open Knowledge versus 'new transacitional methodologies'

Andiamo

Service designers

"develop orthotics for people within 1 week globally"

Naveed looking at software to enable printing of orthotics

Demand and capacity gaps and clinical evidence gap

**Industrial led culture leads and inhibits/inhabits everything**

### Half-Cut Stack: is thinking about 'the Full Stack' important here?...
*Influencing the stack and standards committees*

Material science in additive manufacturing is very poor... FDA in America is still the main regulator
Service Design is poor: Look at OnShape

Empathy can create radical disruption

Danger of throwing hyped tech and methodologies at things.

Go in for one thing and have completely unrelated inspiring conversation about something else

What is an innovation space? Experience of being approached by 2 designers in MakerFaire about how to design stuff; I just gave completely conflicting advice! Wanting your cake and eating it but also cooking it and assembling the cooker element.

## Diverse Critical Bolt holes for innovation and play 

The whole day made me think on [Markus Brinkmann's](http://blog.marcus-brinkmann.de/) idea of hackerspaces as **Havens** for people and knowledge from our [PublicEngineering Project](http://wiki.doesliverpool.com/PublicEngineering) which I blogged about [here](http://cheapjack.github.io/2014/06/18/publicengineering-is-a-response-to-bochum-in-the/)

Essentially rather than utilise and harness the makespace it's more about distributing some of the methods and madness and growing them in sustainable bubbles that may have all kinds of different organisational structures. But rather than make them too big (See Article on [Leopole Kohr](http://www.smarturbanism.org.uk/wherever-something-is-wrong-something-is-too-big/) make them truly diverse.

See [this article via McFilter](https://medium.com/hidden-sustainability/float-like-a-fab-lab-sting-like-a-honey-bee-4f9eab3b70c1) to realise that the Future Makespaces project could look at some similar community technology meets industrial culture pasts like the [Lucas Plan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=10&v=0pgQqfpub-c) as always excellent internet filtering by [McFilter](http://www.mcqn.net/mcfilter/) not to be confused with [MCFilter](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/mcfilter/)

Critical of over-hype in co-design but clearly we are all really focussed on Co-Designing with families
Critical of imagination without restraint but then focussed on imagination?
Critical of gestural provocations but then always bringing it back to one
