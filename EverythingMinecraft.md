# CloudMaker

**Overview of Resources and Activity developed from the FACT CloudMaker project**

**Exploring how Minecraft can be used a platform for social design and collaborative learning.**

**A creative curated package of activity and existing IT and community resources to explore the Minecraft phenomenon as a educational Utility**

I've been involved with FACT CloudMaker project since meeting Paul Harter at Maker Faire Newcastle in 2013. This is an overview of Everything the project has led to and developed.

Special Thanks to Researcher Dr Mark Wright for his support and vision and the FACT team who consistently support innovative engagement work.
