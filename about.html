I'm an artist who sets up activity, events & systems to explore how knowledge is produced and shared. This is my current website hosted on github pages.
<br>
<br>Alot of my work engages with a place or subject and then explores it by bringing together an often trans-discipline mix of people and collaborators.
<br><br>
I'm also interested in infrastructure; everything we make is built on something someone else has made or thought of. There's a critical history inside every tool we use, conceptual or technical. 
<br><h2>Some thoughts on tools</h2>

<br>This website is built on <strong>Jekyll-Bootstrap</strong> and hosted for free on github pages; and like most things we use on the <strong>internet</strong>, and just like <strong>books</strong>, all built on other people's hard work. The content was previously on <strong>Tumblr</strong>, someone else's hard work. 

<br>I love Tumblr but wanted to take ownership of the content and be able to put it in a more standard and simpler form. Ideally this should be nice simple <strong>html</strong> but, well I found a way of exporting all my tumblr content safely into github pages while maintaining all the structure and meta data ie tags. As a recent convert to <strong>git</strong> and <strong>github</strong> and even <strong>gitprint</strong> and things like <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">gitlab</a> to maintain and project manage information, it made sense while also sensibly serve simple static webpages. 

<br>I like to celebrate the tools and knowledge we use to be creative. I'm consistently interested in who's knowledge we use and why. The use of tools is a connection to a wider community of knowledge beyond our individual experience and expression.

<br> Much of my intent curatorially is to refer back and engage with the knowledge I aquire and profit from.
