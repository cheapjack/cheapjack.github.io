### Cheapjack is me, Ross Dalziel, an artist who sets up activity, events & makes systems to explore how knowledge is produced and shared. 

**I like to play with how research & knowledge is produced; who makes it, receives it, where they make it and how.**

I usually put together events, systems and situations that explore this. I then bring people from different disciplines together to make things happen. I'm based at [DoES Liverpool](http://doesliverpool.com/) a brilliant Makerspace in the heart of Liverpool City Centre.
