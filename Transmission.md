His final work in Bogota was a social event in [Parque Virgilio Barco](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblioteca_Virgilio_Barco) featuring the well known Bogota band Los Gaiteros de San Jacinto performing their traditional versions of ‘Love Will Tear Us Apart’ by Joy Division and ‘Paint It Black’ by the rolling Stones

The video below, “Chas or Dave” is part of Ross’s solo show back in the UK based on his residency material along the themes of Folk music as technology and the transfer of meaning across cultures through popular music. This show installed for 3 months in the Harris Museum’s stairway space June - August 2006 also featured an intervention in nearby Preston Market playing sound recordings from Bogota on old tape decks video installations of events in Bogota and a 4 channel sound installation in the stairway space in July 2006.
